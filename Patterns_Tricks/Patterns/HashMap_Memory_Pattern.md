>  Use a **HashMap** to solve "find a pair that sums to a target" problems in a single pass **(O(n))**. This pattern dramatically improves performance by trading a small amount of memory for a massive reduction in time complexity.

## ðŸ¤” The Problem: The Slow Nested Loop (O(nÂ²))

The brute-force approach to finding a pair that sums to a target involves a nested loop. For each element, you iterate through the rest of the array to see if you can find its complement.

```typescript
// Brute-force O(nÂ²) approach
function findPairSlowly(nums: number[], target: number): number[] | null {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target) {
        return [i, j];
      }
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```
This works, but it's very inefficient for large arrays because the number of comparisons grows quadratically.

## ðŸ’¡ The Solution: The Single-Pass Hash Map (O(n))

The optimized solution uses a HashMap to store the numbers we've already seen and their indices.

### The Logic (Step-by-Step)
1.  Initialize an empty HashMap (in JavaScript, a `Map` or a plain object).
2.  Loop through the array **exactly once**.
3.  Inside the loop, for the current number `num`, calculate its **complement**: `complement = target - num`.
4.  Check if this `complement` **already exists as a key** in the HashMap.
    -   **If YES:** You have found the pair! The answer is the index of the complement (which you retrieve from the map) and the index of the current number.
    -   **If NO:** Add the **current number `num`** and its index to the HashMap, so it can be found as a complement by a future number.

### Code Example (The "Two Sum" Problem)

```typescript
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] | null {
  // The map will store: { number => index }
  const seenNumbers = new Map<number, number>();

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const currentNum = nums[i];
    const complement = target - currentNum;

    // Check if the complement we need has been seen before
    if (seenNumbers.has(complement)) {
      // If yes, we've found our pair!
      return [seenNumbers.get(complement)!, i];
    }

    // If not, add the current number and its index to the map for future lookups
    seenNumbers.set(currentNum, i);
  }

  // If we finish the loop without finding a pair
  return null;
}

// Usage:
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
console.log(twoSum(nums, target)); // Output: [0, 1] (because nums[0] + nums[1] === 9)
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Complexity Analysis

-   **Time Complexity: O(n)**
    We iterate through the array of `n` elements exactly once. Each lookup (`.has()`) and insertion (`.set()`) in a HashMap is, on average, a constant time O(1) operation.
-   **Space Complexity: O(n)**
    In the worst-case scenario (where no pair is found until the very end, or not at all), the HashMap will store up to `n` elements.

## ðŸ¤” When to Use This Pattern

You should immediately consider this pattern whenever a problem involves:

-   **Finding pairs of elements that sum up to a specific target** (the classic "Two Sum" problem).
-   **Checking for the existence of duplicates** in an array (if `map.has(currentNumber)`, you've found a duplicate).
-   **Finding anagrams** (use a map to store character counts and compare them).
-   Any situation where you want to **avoid a nested loop** that searches for a second element with a specific relationship (e.g., complementary, identical) to the current element.
