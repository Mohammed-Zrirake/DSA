>  An array is a fundamental, linear data structure that stores a collection of same-typed elements in **contiguous memory**. Its most powerful feature is **O(1) random access**, allowing you to retrieve any element instantly if you know its index.

> [!note] 📖 The Core Analogy: The Numbered Parking Lot
> An array is like a large, numbered parking lot.
> -   **Contiguous Memory:** All the parking spots are right next to each other in a single, unbroken line.
> -   **Homogeneous Elements:** The lot is designed for one type of vehicle, like "Cars Only." You can't park a boat in a car spot.
> -   **Index-Based Access:** Every spot has a unique number painted on the ground (its index).
> -   **`O(1)` Random Access:** If you want to find the car in spot `42`, you don't have to search the lot. You can drive directly to it because its location is predictable (`base_address + 42 * size_of_spot`). This is incredibly fast.
> -   **`O(n)` Insertion/Deletion:** If a car leaves from the middle of a row, every car behind it has to shift forward one spot to fill the gap, which is a slow and tedious process.
> -   **Fixed Size:** The parking lot is built with a fixed number of spots. You can't easily add more spots once it's constructed.

## ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons

### Pros
✔️ **Fast Random Access:** The most significant advantage. Accessing any element by its index is a constant time **`O(1)`** operation because its memory address can be calculated directly (`base_address + index * element_size`).
✔️ **Memory Efficiency (Cache Locality):** Since elements are stored side-by-side in memory, when the CPU fetches one element, it often pre-loads adjacent elements into its high-speed cache. This makes iterating through an array very fast.
✔️ **Simplicity:** Arrays are simple to understand and use, serving as the foundation for more complex data structures like stacks, queues, and heaps.

### Cons
❌ **Fixed Size:** The size of an array is static and must be declared at creation. This can lead to wasted memory if oversized or require a costly resizing operation (creating a new, larger array and copying all elements).
❌ **Costly Insertions and Deletions:** Adding or removing an element from the middle of an array is an **`O(n)`** operation, as it requires shifting all subsequent elements.
❌ **Homogeneous Elements:** Arrays can only store elements of the same data type.

## 🎯 Use Cases
Arrays are ubiquitous in programming, especially in DSA and Competitive Programming (CP).

-   Storing lists of data where the size is known or can be estimated.
-   Implementing other data structures like stacks, queues, hash tables, and heaps.
-   Problems involving frequent index-based lookups, like in **Dynamic Programming** where memoization tables are often arrays.
-   Representing matrices and grids for problems involving graphs or 2D simulations.
-   As the underlying structure for most sorting and searching algorithms.

## ☕ Useful Java Methods for Arrays in CP

In Competitive Programming, speed is everything. Java's `java.util.Arrays` utility class provides highly optimized static methods that are essential.

### 1. Sorting: `Arrays.sort()`
This is the most frequently used array method.
-   **For Primitive Types (`int[]`, etc.):** Uses a highly optimized **Dual-Pivot Quicksort**. Average-case time complexity is **O(n log n)**.
    ```java
    int[] numbers = {5, 2, 8, 1, 9};
    Arrays.sort(numbers); // numbers is now {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
    ```
-   **For Objects (`String[]`, `Integer[]`, etc.):** Uses **Timsort**, a hybrid stable sorting algorithm. Worst-case time complexity is **O(n log n)** and performs exceptionally well on partially sorted data.
-   **Sorting a Subarray:** You can sort a specific range `[fromIndex, toIndex)`.
    ```java
    int[] arr = {1, 5, 3, 8, 6, 2};
    // Sorts from index 1 (inclusive) to 4 (exclusive)
    Arrays.sort(arr, 1, 4); // arr is now {1, 3, 5, 8, 6, 2}
    ```
-   **Custom Sorting with a Comparator:** Extremely powerful for custom sorting criteria using a lambda function.
    ```java
    String[] words = {"apple", "banana", "kiwi", "cherry"};
    // Sort by string length
    Arrays.sort(words, (a, b) -> a.length() - b.length());
    // words is now {"kiwi", "apple", "cherry", "banana"}
    ```

### 2. Searching: `Arrays.binarySearch()`
Performs a binary search on a **sorted** array in **O(log n)** time.
-   **If found:** Returns the index of the element.
-   **If not found:** Returns a negative value: `-(insertion point) - 1`. The "insertion point" is the index where the element *would be* inserted. This is very useful.
    ```java
    int[] sortedNumbers = {2, 5, 8, 12, 16};
    int index = Arrays.binarySearch(sortedNumbers, 12);      // returns 3
    int notFoundIndex = Arrays.binarySearch(sortedNumbers, 7); // returns -3. (Insertion point is 2, so -(2)-1 = -3)
    ```

### 3. Filling: `Arrays.fill()`
Quickly initializes an array or a part of it with a specific value.
-   **Use Cases:** Initializing a DP table with `-1` (unvisited), or a distance array in graph algorithms with `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
    ```java
    int[] dp = new int[100];
    Arrays.fill(dp, -1); // Fills the entire array with -1
    ```

### 4. Copying: `Arrays.copyOf()` and `Arrays.copyOfRange()`
-   **`Arrays.copyOf(original, newLength)`:** Creates a new array and copies elements. If `newLength` is larger, the extra space is padded with default values (`0`, `null`, etc.).
    ```java
    int[] original = {1, 2, 3};
    int[] copied = Arrays.copyOf(original, 5); // copied is {1, 2, 3, 0, 0}
    ```
-   **`Arrays.copyOfRange(original, from, to)`:** Copies a sub-section of an array `[from, to)`.
    ```java
    int[] source = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int[] destination = Arrays.copyOfRange(source, 1, 4); // destination is {20, 30, 40}
    ```

### 5. Equality Check: `Arrays.equals()` and `Arrays.deepEquals()`
-   **`Arrays.equals(arr1, arr2)`:** Checks for equality in 1D arrays (same elements in the same order).
-   **`Arrays.deepEquals(arr1, arr2)`:** Checks for equality in multi-dimensional arrays.

### 🚀 Fast I/O for Arrays in Java
In competitive programming, `java.util.Scanner` can be too slow for large inputs. A custom `BufferedReader` and `StringTokenizer` is the standard for fast input.
```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.StringTokenizer;

public class FastIO {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine()); // Read array size
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); // Read the line of numbers

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
        }
        // Now the array is populated and ready to be used.
    }
}
```
