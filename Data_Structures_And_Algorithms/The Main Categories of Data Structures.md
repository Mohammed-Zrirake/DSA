>  Data structures are broadly classified into three families based on how they organize data: **Linear** (sequential, like a list), **Non-Linear** (hierarchical or networked, like a tree or a map), and **Hash-Based** (using a function for instant lookups, like a dictionary).

> [!note] 📖 The Core Analogy: Organizing a Photo Album
> Imagine you have a large collection of family photos. How you organize them depends on the story you want to tell.
> -   **Linear (A Simple Photo Album):** You place the photos one after another in chronological order. Each photo has a clear "before" and "after." This is simple and tells a linear story. This is like an **Array** or **Linked List**.
> -   **Non-Linear (A Family Tree Diagram):** You want to show relationships. You place the grandparents at the top, their children below them, and their grandchildren below them. Each person can be connected to many others (parents, siblings, children). This hierarchical structure tells a complex story of relationships. This is like a **Tree** or a **Graph**.
> -   **Hash-Based (An Indexed Box of Photos):** You want to find a specific photo instantly. You assign a unique code to each person (e.g., "JohnSmith1985"). You then put all the photos in a box and create an index card that maps each unique code directly to its photo's location. This is incredibly fast for finding a specific person's photo. This is a **Hash Table**.

## ⛓️ 1. Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures arrange elements in a **sequential or linear manner**. Each element is connected to its previous and next elements. This makes them straightforward to implement and traverse.

### Key Examples
-   **[[Arrays]]:** A collection of elements stored in **contiguous memory locations**. Their key advantage is **constant-time access (O(1))** to any element by its index.
-   **[[Linked Lists]]:** A sequence of **nodes**, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. They are dynamic in size and excel at efficient insertions and deletions in the middle of the sequence.
-   **[[Stacks]]:** A **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** structure. Elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the same end, called the "top."
-   **[[Queues]]:** A **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** structure. Elements are added (enqueued) at one end (the rear) and removed (dequeued) from the other (the front).

## 🌳 2. Non-Linear Data Structures

Non-linear data structures have elements that are **not arranged sequentially**. They have hierarchical or interconnected relationships, allowing them to represent more complex data models like networks.

### Key Examples
-   **[[Trees]]:** Hierarchical structures consisting of a root node and subtrees of children with parent-child relationships. They are fundamental for representing hierarchical data like file systems or organizational charts.
    -   *Common variations in DSA/CP:* Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BSTs), Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees).
-   **[[Graphs]]:** Collections of **nodes (vertices)** and **edges** that connect pairs of nodes. They are crucial for modeling networks and solving problems related to pathfinding (e.g., GPS navigation), connectivity, and network flows.

## #️⃣ 3. Hash-Based Data Structures

Hash-based data structures are a special category that uses a **hash function** to map keys to indices in an array. This provides a way to store and retrieve data with incredibly high efficiency.

> [!tip] The Cornerstone of Competitive Programming
> For their ability to perform insertions, deletions, and lookups in **average-case constant time, O(1)**, hash-based structures are indispensable in competitive programming and technical interviews.

### Key Example
-   **[[Hash Tables]] (or Hash Maps):** Stores **key-value pairs**. A hash function is applied to the key, which generates an index where the value is stored. This allows for near-instant data retrieval.
    -   *Ideal for:* Problems requiring frequent lookups, such as counting the frequency of elements, implementing caches, or checking for duplicates.
    -   *Common Implementations:* Python's `dict`, Java's `HashMap`, JavaScript's `Map` and `Object`.
