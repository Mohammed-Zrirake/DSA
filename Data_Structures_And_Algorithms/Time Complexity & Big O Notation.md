>  Time complexity measures how an algorithm's runtime **scales** with the size of its input. **Big O notation** is the language we use to describe this, focusing on the worst-case scenario to provide a reliable performance guarantee.

> [!note] 📖 The Core Analogy: Finding a Page in a Book
> Time complexity isn't about seconds; it's about how much more work you have to do as the "book" (your input data) gets bigger.
> -   **`O(1)` - Constant Time (The Table of Contents):** You need to find the "Introduction." You look it up in the table of contents and go directly to page 5. It doesn't matter if the book has 50 pages or 5,000 pages; this operation takes the same amount of time.
> -   **`O(n)` - Linear Time (The Coffee Stain):** You need to find the first page with a coffee stain. You have no index. Your only option is to start at page 1 and flip through every single page (`n` pages) until you find it. If the book doubles in size, the worst-case search time also doubles.
> -   **`O(log n)` - Logarithmic Time (The Dictionary Search):** You're looking for the word "Algorithm" in a dictionary. You open to the middle ("M"). "A" comes before "M," so you instantly discard the entire second half of the book. You repeat this process, halving the search space with each step. Even if the dictionary doubles in size, it only takes one extra step to find the word. This is incredibly efficient.
> -   **`O(n²)` - Quadratic Time (The Cross-Reference):** You need to check every page against every other page to find duplicate sentences. For each page you look at, you must then re-read the entire book. If the book has 10 pages, that's roughly 100 comparisons. If it has 1000 pages, that's a million comparisons. The work grows exponentially faster than the book's size.

## 🤔 Why is Time Complexity Important?

Understanding time complexity is vital for writing effective and efficient code.

✔️ **Algorithm Efficiency and Selection:** It provides a standard way to compare different algorithms that solve the same problem, helping you choose the most efficient one.
✔️ **Performance Prediction:** It helps predict how an algorithm will perform as the input size grows, allowing you to anticipate potential performance bottlenecks.
✔️ **Scalability:** It is crucial for designing systems that can handle large datasets without a significant drop in performance.
✔️ **Resource Management:** It helps in making informed decisions about computational resources.

## 📈 How is Time Complexity Measured? (Big O Notation)

Time complexity is most commonly expressed using **Big O notation** (e.g., `O(n)`). This notation describes the **upper bound** of an algorithm's runtime, focusing on how the runtime grows as the input size (`n`) increases. It simplifies analysis by ignoring constants and lower-order terms, concentrating only on the most dominant part of the runtime function.

Here are the common time complexities, from most efficient to least efficient:

-   **🟢 `O(1)` - Constant Time:** The runtime is the same regardless of the input size.
    -   *Example:* Accessing an array element by its index (`myArray[5]`).
-   **🟢 `O(log n)` - Logarithmic Time:** The runtime grows logarithmically. The algorithm becomes more efficient as the input size increases because it halves the problem space with each step.
    -   *Example:* Binary search in a sorted array.
-   **🟡 `O(n)` - Linear Time:** The runtime grows linearly with the input size `n`.
    -   *Example:* Iterating through an array to find the largest element.
-   **🟠 `O(n log n)` - N Log N Time (Log-Linear):** A very common and efficient complexity for sorting algorithms.
    -   *Example:* Merge Sort, Quick Sort (on average).
-   **🔴 `O(n²)` - Quadratic Time:** The runtime is proportional to the square of the input size. Often involves nested loops over the same collection.
    -   *Example:* Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort.
-   **🔴 `O(2ⁿ)` - Exponential Time:** The runtime doubles with each new element in the input. These algorithms are impractical for large inputs.
    -   *Example:* The naive recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers.
-   **🚨 `O(n!)` - Factorial Time:** The runtime grows factorially. These are among the least efficient algorithms and are only feasible for very small `n`.
    -   *Example:* The Traveling Salesman problem solved with a brute-force approach.

> [!tip] Worst, Average, and Best Case
> While Big O is the most common, there are other notations for different scenarios:
> -   **Big O (O): Worst-Case.** This is an upper bound on the runtime. It provides a guarantee: "My algorithm will never be slower than this." This is why it's the most important for reliability.
> -   **Omega (Ω): Best-Case.** A lower bound on the runtime. "My algorithm will never be faster than this."
> -   **Theta (Θ): Average-Case.** A tight bound, describing the typical performance.
>
> In interviews and practical system design, we almost always focus on the **worst-case (Big O)** because we need to plan for and guarantee performance even when conditions are not ideal.
